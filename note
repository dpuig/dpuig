Ease the Experience of Consumer Upgrades: My current role involves consulting with development teams on upgrading functionalities, focusing on configuration, dependencies, and name services where these functionalities will be hosted. I aim to enhance my role in this area by constantly learning about new technology and practices to provide the most efficient and up-to-date advice. My goal for the next quarter is to reduce the time it takes for consumers to upgrade by 15% through improvements in consultation and documentation.

Simplify/Automate the DevOps Pipelines and Onboarding: I work closely with DevOps engineers to solve issues that impact the deployment work, viability of the etcd service, and more. To improve my efficiency, I intend to identify areas of the pipeline that could benefit from automation and work to implement these changes. My goal for the next quarter is to automate at least two manual processes within the DevOps pipeline and to simplify the onboarding process, reducing the average onboarding time by 20%.

Monitor Slack Channels, PRs, and Timely Response: I regularly assist in problem-solving through channels such as #one-dev and consistently review PRs related to projects we work on. I will strive to improve response times and aim to provide immediate solutions whenever possible. My goal for the next quarter is to reduce response times by 10% and improve the PR review process to ensure prompt and quality feedback.

In each of these areas, I will focus on continuous improvement, leveraging my engineering skills, and staying updated with new technologies and practices to ensure the most efficient processes for our teams and the best experience for our consumers. By focusing on these goals, I intend to maximize efficiency and streamline operations for 2Data.
