Set the Agenda: Define what winning looks like, Put enterprise thinking first

As an SRE at 2Data, I've always set clear and measurable goals for my team to articulate what success looks like. I prioritize objectives that align with the wider strategic goals of the company, ensuring that our work is not only beneficial to our team but also contributes to the success of the entire organization. I consistently encourage my team to look beyond our immediate tasks and consider the bigger picture, fostering an enterprise mindset. I have instituted regular team meetings where we discuss our goals, progress, and alignment with the overall corporate strategy.

Bring others with you: build a diverse and inclusive team, seek and provide coaching and feedback, make collaboration essential

I believe in the power of diversity and strive to build a team where everyone feels included and valued. I actively work to foster an environment where differences are celebrated and all voices are heard. I provide regular coaching and constructive feedback to my team members to help them grow and develop. I also encourage them to provide me with feedback, which I take seriously and use to improve my leadership skills. Collaboration is the cornerstone of how I manage my team - I actively promote knowledge sharing, collective problem-solving, and team-based successes.

Do it the right way: communicate frequently, candidly, and clearly

Clear and frequent communication is a priority for me. I ensure that all team members are aware of our goals, progress, and any challenges we are facing. I believe in maintaining an open dialogue, where all feedback and ideas are welcomed and respected. My communication style is candid and transparent; I am forthright about both successes and areas where there is room for improvement. I consistently encourage my team members to do the same, fostering an environment where honesty and clear communication are valued.
