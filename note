We have successfully decommissioned a significant number of our POD services and workflows, with the objective of streamlining operations and reducing redundancy. This also has resulted in less maintenance and thus increased overall efficiency.

Through the investment in test automation, we've achieved a high rate of automation, up to 90%. This includes tests for new features, regression tests, and Canary tests. This has greatly reduced the manual effort in testing, ensuring fast and reliable software releases.

Our build automation initiatives have reached 50% completion using tools such as GitHub Actions and Terraform. This has further enhanced our CI/CD pipelines, reducing the time and human error involved in the building and deployment process.

In an effort to reduce time to action on problems and incidents, we have introduced more responsive monitoring systems and improved our incident response procedures. As a result, we are quicker to identify and rectify issues, thereby enhancing overall system reliability and uptime.

Finally, we've reached a 100% reuse rate of our CF&S platforms, significantly reducing the resources and time consumed in reinventing or redeveloping similar features or modules. By reusing these platforms, we have improved our process efficiency and reduced development timelines.

Overall, the above goals have been central in driving efficiency, reducing operational costs, and accelerating delivery time in our role as an SRE at 2Data.
